        <h2>Abraham Lincoln is my Hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        </p>Abraham Lincoln is my "hero" and I find him truly inspiring in Histoy, especially during the Civil War. 
        <p>Over the last 150 years no one exemplifies these values for me more than Abraham Lincoln. He is not only one of my favorite Presidents but, he was the one who endured and lead the American's through the Civil War. He is inspiring and quite the "heroe" He issued the Emancipation Proclamation that declared forever free those slaves within the Confederacy in 1863. This forever changed the racial prejudices and started the process for civil right changes.
